# Bloom & Balance

Website for a life coach focused on helping overwhelmed professionals find balance. Wanted something warm and approachable - not the typical "hustle culture" coaching vibe.

## The Approach

Took inspiration from some European wellness sites. Lots of soft colors, gentle floating background shapes, and copy that actually sounds human. The whole thing should feel like a deep breath.

## Colors

- Sage green, terracotta, cream
- Serif headings for warmth
- Nothing too corporate

## Features

- Animated background shapes that float around
- Scroll animations on the program cards
- Mobile responsive
- Low-pressure CTAs throughout
