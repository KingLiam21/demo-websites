## 1. Background – "Paint Me a Picture"

*Keep it short and clear. You don't live here, you're just getting the map.*

| Question |
|----------|
| "Talk me through your set-up – how many branches, which areas?" |
| "Which portals do you use right now?" |
| "How do vendors or landlords usually find you?" |
| "How do you decide if a portal is working for you?" |

---

## 2. Problems & Opportunities – "What's Great, What's Annoying?"

*This is SPIN "Problem" plus Motivations (challenges & opportunities).*

*Get them talking. The more they say, the less you have to "sell" later.*

| Question |
|----------|
| "What's frustrating you most about your current portal mix?" |
| "Where do you think you're leaving easy opportunities on the table?" |
| "What are you worried might get worse if nothing changes?" |
| "Where do you see real growth potential in your patch?" |

---

## 3. Impact – "Why Does This Actually Matter?"

*This is SPIN "Implication" and Impact questions.*

*You want them to feel the cost of doing nothing.*

| Question |
|----------|
| "What effect is that having on your pipeline right now?" |
| "How does that affect your fees or your ability to hold commission?" |
| "How many instructions do you think you lose each month because of this?" |
| "If nothing changed for a year, what would that mean for your business?" |

---

## 4. Needs & Value – "What Good Looks Like"

*This is SPIN "Need-Payoff" and Needs/Wants & Value layer.*

*At this point, they've basically told you the reasons to buy.*

| Question |
|----------|
| "Where do you need to get to in the next 12 months to feel comfortable?" |
| "What do you need more of – valuation opportunities, landlord leads, quality applicants?" |
| "How important is it for you to make a change this year, honestly?" |
| "If we could help you win just [X] more good instructions per branch per year without adding a big monthly portal bill, what would that mean to you?" |
