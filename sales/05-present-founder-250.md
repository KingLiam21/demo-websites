## Quick ROI (Value Selling)

*No spreadsheets. Just clean, believable maths.*

### The "One Extra Deal" Logic

> "Your average fee is about [£Y], right?"

> "If this helped you win just **one extra good instruction per branch per year**, it would cover the £250 per branch easily. Anything above that is upside."

> "Plus, it gives you a story to tell vendors – 'we're a founding partner on an innovation-led portal' – which helps you hold fees."

### ROI Example

| Their average fee | Cost per branch | Break-even |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| £3,000 | £250 | **0.08 deals** (less than 1!) |
| £5,000 | £250 | **0.05 deals** |
| £2,000 | £250 | **0.13 deals** |

*One extra instruction = paid for many times over.*

## Script Template

```
"So here's how we bridge that gap.

Home.co.uk has always been free to list – that's not changing.

What we're doing now is investing in tools that actually help move chains,
not just display listings.

Founder 250 is our way of giving a small group of early agents
'founding partner' status at just £250 per branch.

You get:
• The Founder badge – great for vendor presentations
• Permanent enhanced visibility – you keep this forever
• Early access to new tools before they go to everyone
• Association with a portal that's about innovation, not just fees

Your average fee is around [£X], right?

So if this helps you win just one extra good instruction per branch per year,
it's paid for itself many times over.

And honestly, it gives you a story: 'We're founding partners on an innovation-led portal.'
That helps you hold your fees when you're in a valuation."
