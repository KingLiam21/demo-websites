# Stage 6: Handle Worries (Objections)

> **Goal:** Make them feel heard, fix what's real, and find out if anything else is in the way.

---

## Explain It Simply

> "If someone frowns, don't argue. Ask why they're worried, fix it if you can, then check if they're okay now."

## Example: "We Already Spend Too Much on Portals"

### 1. Acknowledge
> "I get that – a lot of agents feel portal costs have gone crazy."

### 2. Ask More
> "Which one feels most painful to you right now and why?"

### 3. Isolate
> "So the real concern is just having 'one more big bill', yeah?"

### 4. Answer with Benefits
> "That's why we've kept this at £250 per branch and stayed free to list. This isn't another massive monthly portal fee; it's a one-off-style investment to lock in founding partner status and permanent extra visibility."

### 5. Check Back
> "If we keep it at that level, and you get those permanent benefits, does that take the edge off that concern?"

## Common Objections Cheatsheet

| Objection | Acknowledge | Isolate | Answer |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| "We spend too much on portals" | "Totally get that – costs have gone crazy" | "So it's about not adding another big bill?" | "That's why it's £250 one-off, not monthly – and we're free to list" |
| "We're happy with current portals" | "Great that things are working" | "Is it more about not wanting to add complexity?" | "This isn't a replacement – it's extra visibility and a story for vendors" |
| "I need to think about it" | "Of course, it's worth considering properly" | "Is there something specific you want to think through?" | "Happy to answer that now / follow up in [X] days" |
| "Now isn't the right time" | "Makes sense, timing matters" | "Is it budget timing or workload?" | "Shall we lock in the rate now and start in [month]?" |
| "What's the catch?" | "Fair question!" | "You're wondering what we get out of it?" | "We're building a partner network early – you get locked-in benefits, we get committed agents" |
| "I've never heard of Home.co.uk" | "That's fair, we're not a household name yet" | "So it's about credibility?" | "We've been running since [X], we're investing in innovation, and Founder 250 is how we're building our best agent network" |

## Pro Tips

✅ **Never argue** – acknowledge first, always

✅ **Dig deeper** – the first objection is rarely the real one

✅ **Isolate** – make sure you're solving the actual concern

✅ **Use "That's exactly why..."** – turns objection into reason to buy

✅ **Always check back** – don't assume you've fixed it
