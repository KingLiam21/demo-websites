# Stage 7: Agree & Start (Close + Next Steps)

> **Goal:** Get a clear yes/no and a clear "what happens next".

---

## Explain It Simply

> "If they say they like it, don't just smile. Ask, 'Shall we do it?' and agree what you both do tomorrow."

---

## Up-Front Contract (Sandler-Style)

*Set this at the very start of a discovery or demo:*

> "We've got 20 minutes. I'll ask a few questions, share what other agents are doing, and if it makes sense we'll talk through Founder 250. At the end, can we agree to either decide it's a **yes**, a **no**, or a **clear next step**?"

**Why this works:** It gives you permission to close later without feeling pushy.

---

## Simple Close Language

After you've handled questions:

### 1. Recap Their Own Words

> "You said your main goals were to stand out locally and win more instructions without cutting your fees..."

### 2. Tie to Your Offer

> "...and Founder 250 helps with that by giving you the Founder badge for vendor presentations and permanent enhanced visibility."

### 3. Ask Clearly

> "Shall we start with your [X] branches so you can use this in valuations this quarter?"

**OR**

> "Would you prefer to begin with your flagship office or roll it out across all three local branches from day one?"

### 4. Then Shut Up

*Let them answer. Don't fill the silence.*

## Close Question Options

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Direct** | "Shall we get you started?" |
| **Assumptive** | "Which branches should we include?" |
| **Choice** | "One branch to start, or all three from day one?" |
| **Timeline** | "Want to be live before your next valuation push?" |

## If YES

### Confirm Details

- [ ] Branches included
- [ ] When it goes live
- [ ] What you need from them (logos, approvals, contact details)

### Book Next Steps

- [ ] Onboarding call (within 1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Check-in date (4-6 weeks after go-live)

### Example Confirmation

> "Brilliant – so we're doing your Guildford and Woking branches. I'll send the paperwork today, we'll aim to go live next Monday, and I'll need your logo and a quick approval from you. Then let's book a check-in for 6 weeks' time to see how it's going. Sound good?"

---

## If "NOT NOW" But Real Interest

### Set a Dated Next Step

> "Sounds like timing is the main blocker. Shall we pencil in a 15-minute review for [month], and I'll bring data on how other Founder 250 agents have used it?"

### Always Get:

- [ ] A specific date/time for follow-up
- [ ] What would need to change for them to move forward
- [ ] Permission to send relevant updates in the meantime

---

## If NO

### Stay Professional

> "No problem at all. If anything changes, I'd love to chat again. Mind if I check in once a quarter just to share any updates?"

### Note the Reason

Record why they said no – useful for future outreach.
