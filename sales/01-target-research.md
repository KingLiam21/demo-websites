# Stage 1: Target & Research

> **Goal:** Talk to the right people with a bit of context so you don't sound random.

## What Reps Actually Do

### 1. Build a List

**Which agents, which branches, which towns.**

For each account, capture:

| Field | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Who runs it | Owner, manager, director |
| Current portals | Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket (check websites/window displays) |
| Rough size | One branch vs group |

### 2. Note a Guess About Their World

Make an educated assumption:

- *"Probably struggling with high portal costs."*
- *"Looks like a growth-minded independent."*
- *"Seems established but maybe stuck in old ways."*
- *"Recently opened second branch – ambitious."*

## Output

A short note per account:

```
ACCOUNT: [Agency Name]
─────────────────────────────────
Who they are:     Independent, 2 branches, Surrey
Key person:       Sarah Mitchell (Director)
Current portals:  Rightmove, Zoopla
My guess:         Frustrated with portal costs, wants to look modern
Who to call:      Sarah (decision maker)
```
