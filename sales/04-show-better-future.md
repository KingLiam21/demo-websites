# Stage 4: Show a Better Future (GAP + Challenger + JTBD)

> **Goal:** Reframe their thinking and show them a clear "before → after" story using their words.

---

## Explain It Simply

> "They tell you their 'now' and their 'dream.' You show them the movie of how life looks when the problems are fixed."

---

## GAP Structure

### 1. Current State (what they told you)

> "Right now, you're spending [£X] on portals, you feel innovation has stalled, and you're struggling to stand out locally."

### 2. Future State (what they want)

> "You told me you want to be seen as a modern, data-driven agent, win more instructions without cutting fees, and not be so dependent on the big portals."

### 3. The Gap

> "So the gap is: a low-cost way to boost your online presence and brand, that ties you to innovation rather than just another bill."

## JTBD – "What Job Are They Hiring You For?"

*You're not selling "a portal upgrade"; you're helping them do a specific job in their business.*

### Phrase it like this:

> "You're really trying to win more good instructions without slashing fees and show vendors you use modern tech, right?"

> "This is exactly the kind of job Home is built for – helping agents look progressive and visible, without piling on more listing fees."

---

## Template: Play Back Their Story

Use this structure:

```
"So just to make sure I've got this right...

RIGHT NOW, you're [current state - use their words].

WHERE YOU WANT TO BE is [future state - use their words].

THE GAP between those two is [problem to solve].

Does that sound about right?"
```

### Example:

> "So just to make sure I've got this right...
>
> Right now, you're paying around £1,500 a month on Rightmove and Zoopla, and you feel like you're not getting much innovation for that – just the same old listings.
>
> Where you want to be is seen as a modern, tech-forward agent that stands out locally and wins instructions without having to cut your fees.
>
> The gap between those two is finding a way to boost your visibility and brand that doesn't just add another massive bill.
>
> Does that sound about right?"
