## First Contact Call Script

```
YOU: "Hi [Name], it's [You] from Home.co.uk. Can I steal 30 seconds 
      to explain why I'm calling, then you can decide if we talk 
      further another time?"

[Wait for yes]

YOU: "We're the portal that's stayed free to list, and we're now 
      investing in tools that help agents move chains faster, 
      instead of just charging bigger listing fees."

YOU: "Quick question – which portals are you relying on most at 
      the moment to win instructions?"

[Listen]

YOU: "A lot of agents are saying portal costs keep rising while 
      innovation has slowed. Is that true for you, or are you 
      pretty happy?"

[Listen]

YOU: "If there was a way to lock in a 'founding partner' status 
      with us at £250 per branch and get permanent extra visibility, 
      would you be open to a 20-minute call where I can show you 
      what that looks like for [Town]?"

[If yes: book the call]
```

## Discovery Call Opening

```
YOU: "Thanks for making time. We've got 20 minutes. I'll ask a few 
      questions to understand your set-up, share what other agents 
      are doing, and if it makes sense we'll talk through Founder 250. 
      At the end, can we agree to either decide it's a yes, a no, 
      or a clear next step?"
```

## Discovery Questions (Copy-Paste)

### Background
- "Talk me through your set-up – how many branches, which areas?"
- "Which portals do you use right now?"
- "How do vendors or landlords usually find you?"
- "How do you decide if a portal is working for you?"

### Problems & Opportunities
- "What's frustrating you most about your current portal mix?"
- "Where do you think you're leaving easy opportunities on the table?"
- "What are you worried might get worse if nothing changes?"
- "Where do you see real growth potential in your patch?"

### Impact
- "What effect is that having on your pipeline right now?"
- "How does that affect your fees or your ability to hold commission?"
- "How many instructions do you think you lose each month because of this?"
- "If nothing changed for a year, what would that mean for your business?"

### Needs & Value
- "Where do you need to get to in the next 12 months to feel comfortable?"
- "What do you need more of – valuation opportunities, landlord leads, quality applicants?"
- "How important is it for you to make a change this year, honestly?"
- "If we could help you win just [X] more good instructions per branch per year without adding a big monthly portal bill, what would that mean to you?"

## GAP Summary Template

```
"So just to make sure I've got this right...

RIGHT NOW, you're [current state - use their words].

WHERE YOU WANT TO BE is [future state - use their words].

THE GAP between those two is [problem to solve].

Does that sound about right?"
```

---

## Founder 250 Pitch

```
"Here's how we help close that gap.

Home.co.uk has always been free to list – that's not changing.

What we're doing now is investing in tools that actually help 
move chains, not just display listings.

Founder 250 is our way of giving a small group of early agents 
'founding partner' status at just £250 per branch.

You get:
• The Founder badge – great for vendor presentations
• Permanent enhanced visibility – you keep this forever
• Early access to new tools before they go to everyone
• Association with a portal that's about innovation, not just fees

Your average fee is around [£X], right?

So if this helps you win just one extra good instruction per 
branch per year, it's paid for itself many times over.

And honestly, it gives you a story: 'We're founding partners 
on an innovation-led portal.' That helps you hold your fees 
when you're in a valuation."
```

"Shall we get you started?"

CHOICE:

```
