# Stage 2: First Contact (Cold/Warm Call)

> **Goal:** Don't sell the full thing. Just earn a short meeting or discovery call.

---

## Explain It Simply

> "On the first call, your job isn't to sell the whole cake – just to get them to taste a small slice later."

---

## Call Structure

1. **Permission opener**
2. **Simple "why I'm calling"**
3. **One or two questions**
4. **Invite to a proper chat**

---

## Example Script

### 1. Permission

> "Hi [Name], it's [You] from Home.co.uk. Can I steal 30 seconds to explain why I'm calling, then you can decide if we talk further another time?"

### 2. Why I'm Calling (Challenger Hint)

> "We're the portal that's stayed free to list, and we're now investing in tools that help agents move chains faster, instead of just charging bigger listing fees."

### 3. Background Question (SPIN 'Situation')

> "Which portals are you relying on most at the moment to win instructions?"

### 4. Pain/Opportunity Question (SPIN 'Problem')

> "A lot of agents are saying portal costs keep rising while innovation has slowed. Is that true for you, or are you pretty happy?"

### 5. Invite

> "If there was a way to lock in a 'founding partner' status with us at £250 per branch and get permanent extra visibility, would you be open to a 20-minute call where I can show you what that looks like for [Town]?"
