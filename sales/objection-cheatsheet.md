# Objection Handling Cheatsheet

Quick reference for the most common objections. Use the 5-step structure:

**Acknowledge → Ask More → Isolate → Answer with Benefits → Check Back**

---

## "We already spend too much on portals"

| Step | What to say |
|------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge** | "I get that – a lot of agents feel portal costs have gone crazy." |
| **Ask More** | "Which one feels most painful to you right now and why?" |
| **Isolate** | "So the real concern is just having 'one more big bill', yeah?" |
| **Answer** | "That's why we've kept this at £250 per branch and stayed free to list. This isn't another massive monthly portal fee; it's a one-off-style investment to lock in founding partner status and permanent extra visibility." |
| **Check Back** | "If we keep it at that level, and you get those permanent benefits, does that take the edge off that concern?" |

---

## "We're happy with our current portals"

| Step | What to say |
|------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge** | "Great that things are working for you." |
| **Ask More** | "What's working best about your current setup?" |
| **Isolate** | "So it's more about not wanting to add complexity or another thing to manage?" |
| **Answer** | "This isn't a replacement for what's working – it's extra visibility and a story for vendors. The Founder badge is something you can use in valuations to show you're forward-thinking." |
| **Check Back** | "If it adds to what you're doing rather than replacing it, would that make more sense?" |

---

## "I need to think about it"

| Step | What to say |
|------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge** | "Of course – it's worth considering properly." |
| **Ask More** | "Is there something specific you want to think through, or is it more about finding the right time?" |
| **Isolate** | "So it's [specific concern] that you want to work through?" |
| **Answer** | [Address the specific concern] |
| **Check Back** | "Does that help, or would it be useful to chat again in a week with any other questions?" |

---

## "Now isn't the right time"

| Step | What to say |
|------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge** | "Makes sense – timing matters." |
| **Ask More** | "Is it a budget timing thing, or more about workload right now?" |
| **Isolate** | "So if the timing was better in [month], you'd be interested?" |
| **Answer** | "We could lock in the rate now and set a start date for when it works better. That way you don't miss the founding partner window." |
| **Check Back** | "Would that work for you?" |

---

## "What's the catch?"

| Step | What to say |
|------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge** | "Fair question! I'd ask the same thing." |
| **Ask More** | "Is it more 'what do you get out of it' or 'what's going to cost me more later'?" |
| **Isolate** | "So you're wondering why we'd offer this so cheaply?" |
| **Answer** | "We're building a partner network early. You get locked-in benefits and founding partner status. We get committed agents who help us grow and shape what we build. It's a fair trade." |
| **Check Back** | "Does that make sense?" |

---

## "I've never heard of Home.co.uk"

| Step | What to say |
|------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge** | "That's fair – we're not a household name like Rightmove yet." |
| **Ask More** | "Is the concern about credibility, or more about whether it's worth your time?" |
| **Isolate** | "So you want to know we're legitimate and worth associating with?" |
| **Answer** | "We've been running since [year], we're investing in innovation, and Founder 250 is how we're building our best agent network. The founding partner status is permanent – so you're getting in early with a portal that's growing, not declining." |
| **Check Back** | "Would it help if I shared a couple of examples of other agents in your area who've joined?" |

---

## "I don't have time for another portal"

| Step | What to say |
|------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge** | "Totally understand – you're busy enough already." |
| **Ask More** | "What takes up most of your time with your current portals?" |
| **Isolate** | "So it's more about admin and hassle than the concept itself?" |
| **Answer** | "Founder 250 is designed to be low-maintenance. Your listings sync automatically if you're already on major portals, and the Founder badge works in the background. It's more 'set and benefit' than another thing to manage." |
| **Check Back** | "If it genuinely didn't add to your workload, would that change things?" |

---

## "£250 is still money"

| Step | What to say |
|------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge** | "Absolutely – every cost matters." |
| **Ask More** | "Is it the £250 itself, or more about making sure you see a return?" |
| **Isolate** | "So if you could see how it pays for itself, that would help?" |
| **Answer** | "Your average fee is around [£X]. If Founder 250 helps you win just one extra instruction per branch per year – and with the visibility and vendor story, that's realistic – it's paid for itself ten times over." |
| **Check Back** | "Does that ROI make it feel more reasonable?" |

---

## "Let me talk to my partner/boss"

| Step | What to say |
|------|-------------|
| **Acknowledge** | "Of course – makes sense to loop them in." |
| **Ask More** | "What do you think they'll want to know most?" |
| **Isolate** | "So if [partner/boss] is comfortable with [concern], you'd be ready to go?" |
| **Answer** | "Would it help if I put together a one-pager you can share with them? Or I'm happy to jump on a quick call with both of you." |
| **Check Back** | "Which would work best?" |
