# Stage 8: Look After & Grow (Account Management & Expansion)

> **Goal:** Make sure customers stay happy, get value, and want more.

## Explain It Simply

> "Once someone joins your club, you don't just forget them. You help them enjoy it so much that they stay longer and invite their friends."

## What Reps / AMs Do

### 1. Onboarding

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Help them go live smoothly | Guide through setup, check everything works |
| Train the branch team | Make sure staff know what Founder 250 is |
| Arm them with vendor talking points | "Here's how to mention this in valuations" |

**Onboarding goal:** They're using it and can talk about it within 2 weeks.

---

### 2. Check-ins (Every Few Months)

| Action | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Bring a couple of insights | Data, examples, market trends |
| Run a mini-discovery again | "What's changed? Any new problems or goals?" |
| Show small wins | Screenshots, examples, anecdotes |

**Check-in goal:** Keep the relationship warm, spot problems early, find expansion opportunities.

#### Check-in Questions

- "How's the team finding Founder 250 so far?"
- "Have you used the badge in any valuations?"
- "What's changed in your business since we last spoke?"
- "Any new branches or big plans coming up?"

---

### 3. Spot Expansion Opportunities

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| New branches opening | Offer to roll out Founder 250 |
| Strong advocates inside the firm | Ask for introductions |
| Good results in one area | Use as case study + expand to others |
| New decision-makers joining | Introduce yourself + the partnership |

---

## Expansion Process

When you spot an opportunity, **reuse the same process** on extra branches:

```
Discovery → GAP → Bridge → ROI → Close
```

> "You mentioned you're opening a new branch in Farnham. Want me to show you how other Founder 250 agents have launched new branches with the badge from day one?"

## Vendor Talking Points (For Branch Staff)

Give them simple scripts to use:

> "We're founding partners with Home.co.uk – they're the portal focused on innovation rather than just charging fees."

> "You'll see our listings there with enhanced visibility because of our Founder status."

> "We're always looking for ways to be more visible online without passing costs on to you."
