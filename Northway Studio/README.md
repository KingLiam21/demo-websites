# Northway Studio

One-pager for a fictional creative agency. Going for that confident, editorial look - the kind of site that makes you think "these people know what they're doing."

## Design Notes

- Charcoal background, warm white text, burnt orange accents
- Lots of whitespace
- Custom SVG logo
- Service cards in a grid
- Portfolio previews

Pretty straightforward build. The hover effects do most of the heavy lifting.

## To Run

Open `index.html`. That's it.
