# Demo Websites

A few demo sites I've been building to showcase different design approaches. Each folder is self-contained - just open the index.html in a browser.

## What's Here

- **Voltix** - SaaS productivity tool landing page. Lots of animations, pricing tables, the works.
- **Harbor & Stone** - Boutique hotel site for a fictional Maine coastal retreat. Going for that luxury editorial feel.
- **Bloom & Balance** - Life coach website with warm, calming vibes and gentle animations.
- **Northway Studio** - Creative agency one-pager. Clean, confident, editorial.

## Running Them

No build step or anything - just open any `index.html` in your browser and you're good.
