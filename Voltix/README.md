# Voltix

SaaS landing page for a fictional productivity tool. The brief was "make visitors immediately think this will save them time" - so everything points toward that.

## What's In It

- Hero with rotating benefit text
- Animated logo marquee
- Feature cards with hover effects
- 3-step "how it works" section
- Pricing table (3 tiers)
- FAQ accordion
- Testimonials and stats
- Video modal for the demo
- Mobile hamburger menu

Went a bit overboard with the features but it's a good showcase of what's possible with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

## Colors

Indigo primary, purple secondary, green for success states. Dark mode aesthetic.

## To Run

Open `index.html` in a browser.
