# Sales Process Site

Built this as an internal playbook for the Founder 250 sales team. Needed something that felt more engaging than a boring PDF or a static wiki page - wanted the team to actually enjoy using it.

## What It Does

It's basically our entire sales methodology turned into an interactive website. Everything from cold call openers to objection handling to QBR templates. The idea is that a rep can quickly jump to whatever section they need before or during a call.

## The Interactive Bits

Went a bit overboard on making it feel fun to use, but I think it makes a difference:

- **Falling Text** - the hero title drops in letter by letter, looks pretty cool
- **Card Swap** - the product positioning section uses swipeable cards instead of walls of text
- **Carousel** - all 8 pipeline stages in a carousel you can click through
- **Bounce Cards** - the methodology and benefits sections have cards that bounce in as you scroll
- **Flip Cards** - scripts are on flip cards so you can see the title first, then click to reveal the actual script
- **Animated Lists** - questions animate in with a stagger effect
- **Accordion** - objection handling uses an expanding accordion
- **Dark Veil** - subtle particle background effect that changes as you scroll

## Content Sections

1. **Overview** - What Founder 250 is, the value pillars, who we're selling to
2. **Methodology** - SPIN, Challenger, the inverted question funnel
3. **Pipeline** - All 8 stages from targeting to expansion
4. **Question Bank** - Tabbed interface with all the discovery questions
5. **Objections** - The APIR-C framework plus common objections and how to handle them
6. **Scripts** - Cold call opener, recommendation formula, value framing, closing lines
7. **Account Management** - Timeline for post-sale through QBRs
8. **Coaching & KPIs** - Training path and metrics to track

## How To Use

Just open `index.html` in a browser. No build step or server needed.

## Colours

Mostly indigo/purple gradient for the primary, with a dark theme for contrast sections. Green for success states, amber for tips.

## Mobile

Should work fine on mobile - the carousel and cards are all swipeable, and the layout stacks nicely on smaller screens.

## Notes

- Double-click on any script content to copy it to clipboard
- Keyboard navigation works on the carousel (arrow keys) and card swap
- The flip cards also flip on hover if you're on desktop

Let me know if anything needs tweaking or if we need to add more content.
